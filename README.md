# 🚀 ML Engineer Journey — Month 1
A structured 30-day roadmap (Month 1 of 3) to becoming an ML Engineer using GitHub Education tools, VS Code, and real-world ML engineering practices.  
This repository documents my progress for the **first month**, with hands-on projects, tools, and templates.  
Future months will expand into more advanced ML and AI projects.

## ✅ Completed Work (Month 1)

### **Day 1 — Environment + Project Setup**
- Installed & configured:
  - Python 3.11  
  - VS Code  
  - Git  
  - GitHub Copilot  
- Created project folder structure:
/projects
/tools
/data
/models
/notebooks

- Added initial README  
- First commit pushed to GitHub  

---

### **Day 2 — Reusable ML Engineering Pipeline Template**
- Built a reusable pipeline template using `scikit-learn`  
- Steps included:
- Load CSV data  
- Preprocessing (scaling, encoding, missing values)  
- Train/test split  
- Model training  
- Evaluation metrics  
- Logging support  
- Uploaded template to GitHub under `/tools/pipeline_template.py`

This template is the foundation for all future ML projects in Month 1.

## 📌 Upcoming Work (Days 3–30)
### **Day 3 — Automated Data Cleaning Tool**
- Script that:
- Cleans CSV files  
- Handles missing values  
- Removes duplicates  
- Detects outliers  
- Generates a summary report  
- Add README instructions and optional Streamlit UI  

### **Days 4–30**
- Continue building ML pipelines and mini-projects  
- Explore feature engineering, modeling, evaluation  
- Prepare portfolio-ready scripts and notebooks  

---

## ⭐ Goals of Month 1
- Build hands-on ML engineering skills  
- Establish a clean, professional project structure  
- Create reusable templates and tools for future projects  
- Document incremental progress clearly
