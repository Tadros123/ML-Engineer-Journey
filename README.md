# ML Engineer Portfolio — Month 1

This repository showcases ML projects and reusable tools I’ve developed to build a strong foundation in machine learning engineering.  
The current focus is on creating flexible pipelines and scripts that can be applied to a variety of datasets.

## Completed Projects / Tools

### ML Pipeline Template
**Location:** `tools/pipeline_template.py`  

A reusable machine learning workflow template built with `scikit-learn`.  

**Features:**
- Load CSV datasets  
- Preprocess data (scaling, encoding, handle missing values)  
- Train/test split  
- Model training and evaluation metrics  

**Purpose:** Provides a consistent structure for building and testing ML models across different datasets, saving time and ensuring best practices.
